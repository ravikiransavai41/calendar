# Deployment Guide for Lovy Tech Application

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying and accessing the Lovy Tech application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- pnpm package manager
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd lovy-tech
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Step 3: Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add the following environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
   # Add other environment variables as needed
   ```

## Step 4: Development Mode

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Step 5: Production Build

To create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Step 6: Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1. Create a Vercel account at https://vercel.com
2. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   pnpm add -g vercel
   ```
3. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to complete deployment

### Option 2: Self-Hosting

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

## Step 7: Accessing the Application

- Development: `http://localhost:3000`
- Production: `https://your-deployed-url.com`

## Step 8: Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your production environment:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Your API endpoint
- Any other required environment variables

## Step 9: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Monitor application logs
2. Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
3. Regular backups of your database
4. Keep dependencies updated

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Build Failures**
   - Clear the `.next` directory and node_modules
   - Run `pnpm install` again
   - Check for version conflicts in package.json

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Check for typos in variable names
   - Verify variable values are correct

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check server resources
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Implement caching strategies

## Support

For additional support:
- Check the project documentation
- Open an issue in the repository
- Contact the development team

## Security Considerations

1. Keep all dependencies updated
2. Use HTTPS in production
3. Implement proper authentication
4. Regular security audits
5. Follow security best practices for environment variables

## Backup and Recovery

1. Regular database backups
2. Version control for all code changes
3. Document recovery procedures
4. Test backup restoration periodically

Remember to update this guide as your application evolves and new deployment requirements arise.
